<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, supervised by [Prof. Guanjie Zheng](https://jhc.sjtu.edu.cn/~gjzheng/). I earned B.Eng. in Computer Science and Technology at [Yingcai Honors College, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China](https://www.yingcai.uestc.edu.cn/), 2021.

My research focuses on data mining and dataset distillation techniques for time series and spatial-temporal data.
